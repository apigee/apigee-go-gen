The `apigee-go-gen` CLI tool streamlines your Apigee development experience using [Go style](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/tutorials/templates/go-template-syntax) templates with a YAML centric workflow.

**Here's what you'll find:**

* **Transformation commands** Easily convert between Apigee's API proxy format and YAML for better readability and management.
* **Template rendering commands**  Enjoy powerful customization and dynamic configuration options, inspired by the flexibility of Helm using the Go [text/template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) engine.

By using this tool alongside the [Apigee CLI](https://github.com/apigee/apigeecli), you'll unlock a highly customizable workflow. This is perfect for both streamlined local development and robust CI/CD pipelines.
