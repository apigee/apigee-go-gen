The `apigee-go-gen` tool includes the following set of template rendering commands to help you create Apigee API proxy bundles and shared flows.

* [render template](./commands/render-template.md) - Renders a [Go-style](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) template
* [render apiproxy](./commands/render-apiproxy.md) - Combines [render template](./commands/render-template.md) and [yaml-to-apiproxy](../transform/commands/yaml-to-apiproxy.md) into one
* [render sharedflow](./commands/render-sharedflow.md) - Combines [render template](./commands/render-template.md) and [yaml-to-sharedflow](../transform/commands/yaml-to-sharedflow.md) into one



## Why use templates

Templates act like blueprints for creating Apigee API proxies, making it easy to generate them from popular formats like OpenAPI, GraphQL, and gRPC.

- [x] **Tailored Control**  
> Craft your API Proxies exactly how you need them, from security policies to dynamic behavior based on environment variables, and more!


- [x] **Unlock Your Specs**  
> Don't just describe your API â€“ use the information in your OpenAPI specs (and others) to automatically build out parts of
your API proxy configuration.


## Template Language

The `render commands` are powered by the Go [text/template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) engine.

Some popular tools that also use this same engine are [Helm](https://helm.sh/), and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## Learn the Language

Here are some resources to get you started with the Go template language:

* Official [text/template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) package docs
* Hashicorp's [Go Template Tutorial](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/tutorials/templates/go-template-syntax)
